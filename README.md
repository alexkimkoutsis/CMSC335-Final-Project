# CMSC335-Final-Project

This is my final project for CMSC335.

Team Members: Alexander Kim-Koutsis (116548861)

This project is based on the concept of freestyle rap - trying to come up with raps spontaneously without a script.
This task is quite difficult as coming up with rhymes on the spot can be tough. Thus, this website gives you the ability
to generate rhymes with ease.

It also lets you view the words that have been searched before using MongoDB.

I am using the Datamuse API to generate rhymes: https://www.datamuse.com/api/

You can access the website here! https://freestylerap.cyclic.app/
